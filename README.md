# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a Bachelor of Science majoring in Computer Science.
- I am taking STATS 220 because I feel it will give me knowledge that is highly appicable to my future career.
- I am interested in learning about R, Web Scraping, and APIs.
