## Introduction

Give the two words you used to search for photos on pexels.com and briefly explain why you chose these words.
Use markdown to provide the URL that matches your search/query.
Use markdown to display the screenshot of the first row of photos returned, as an image within your HTML report.
Describe three features of the photos you noticed when viewing them on pexels.com.
Include a HTML table (using select() and knitr::kable()) that shows just the URLs of your selected photos [this is the variable url].
Write at least 100 words for this section.

The two words I have used to search for photos is "**Easter Bunny**". I have chosen this because it is currently Easter, and I felt that this would be a simple and relevant search term for this festive season.

The first thing that I notice about these photos, is that most of the images seem to either contain a real-life bunny, or is an image of real eggs in colourful paint. This doesn't quite match what I would first think of when imagining Easter Bunny images, but still makes sense as a mistaken product. Most images mainly use pastel pinks, blues, reds, and yellows as their focal colours. These follow a cute aesthetic that is relevant to the Easter Bunny. I notice that the images that contain chocolate in them tend to have larger amounts of likes than most that do not.

the other stuff it says to do about tables or sumn

## Key Features of My Selected Photos

Use a combination of an R chunk(s), markdown and inline R code to produce four different sentences.
Each sentence needs to describe or compare one feature of the data about your selected photos, based on a summary value.
There should be no paste() functions or similar used - instead you need to do your calculations within R chunks, and then use inline R code to seamlessly integrate these values with your written text.
Your inline R code needs to refer to named objects that are in your R chunk(s).

features mmmmm

## Creativity

Use markdown to display the image (meme or animated GIF) you created in Part E.
Describe and justify how your project demonstrates creativity. Be specific about what knowledge and skills you have used from Modules 1 and 2.

creativeness yeah nah 

## Learning Reflection

Describe in your own words at least ONE important idea you learned from Module 3: Creating new variables and data tables
Discuss what things related to data technologies that you are more curious about exploring further
Write at least 100 words for this section of your report
